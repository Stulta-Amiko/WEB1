<h2>JavaScript 란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript" target="_blank" title="JavaScript specification">JS</a> is useful to start with an overview of the language's history. JavaScript was created in 1995 by
    Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape.</p>
<p>JavaScript was first released with Netscape 2 early in 1996. It was originally going to be called LiveScript,</p>
<p> but it was renamed in an ill-fated marketing decision that attempted to capitalize on the popularity of Sun Microsystem's Java language — despite the two having very little in common.</p>
<p> This has been a source of confusion ever since.
