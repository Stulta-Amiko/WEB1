            <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" title="Web specification">The World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs,
                such as https://example.com/),
            </p>
            <p> which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),</p>
            <p>may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.</p>
            <p> The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon the technologies of which the Web is built.</p>
